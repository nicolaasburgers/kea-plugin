Information about the Kea plug-in for Grasshopper (Rhinoceros 3D).

After installing the plug-in using the Package Manager (with "include pre-releases" box ticked) and restarting Rhino, you'll find a new option in the top-level View Menu: AI Script Assistant (Kea). Select that to launch the Kea window.

You'll need at least one set of API keys for one of these AI platforms:
- OpenAI
- Anthropic
- Deepseek

When you have an API key, go to the Settings page of the Kea window, insert the API key in the appropriate box and press Save.

You can then go to the Chat tab, and select the model to use, and start using natural language to request new or changed C# and Python scripts.
